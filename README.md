Source Code:

The initial stage involves writing the source code in a high-level programming language. This code contains the program logic and is the input for the compiler.

Compiler:

The compiler, written in C++, translates the high-level source code into assembly language. This stage involves several sub-processes including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the source code into meaningful symbols.
Syntax Analysis: Constructs a parse tree based on the grammatical structure.
Semantic Analysis: Ensures the code adheres to language rules and meaning.
Optimization: Enhances the code for performance improvements.
Code Generation: Converts the optimized code into assembly language.

Assembly:

The assembly code generated by the compiler is then fed into NASM, which translates it into an object file. This file contains machine code but is not yet executable.

Linker (GNU Linker LD):

The linker takes the object file and links it with any required libraries and other object files to produce the final executable. This step resolves references to external symbols and addresses.

Executable:

The final output is an executable file that can be run on the target machine. This file contains the binary code that the machine's CPU can execute directly.

Development Environment:

The project was developed using CLion, an IDE known for its powerful C++ development features. CLion's robust tools and debugging capabilities were instrumental in the efficient development and testing of the compiler.
